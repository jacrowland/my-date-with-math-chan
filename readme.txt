*** What is this? ***

My Date With Math Chan is a short visual novel using RenPy (a framework for building visual novels in python).

*** What is a visual novel? ***

A visual novel is an interactive narrative where the player can make choices to alter the story (essentially a choose-your-own-adventure book).

*** Why did you make this? ***

This visual novel explores my relationship and emotions towards mathematics (or "What is maths (to you)") as personified by 'Math Chan',
a fictional university student who the player attempts to ask out on a date.

I'm fully aware of how weird this is but this was fun to make and I think it's pretty unique.

*** How to play ***

1. Open the "datewithmathchan.exe" (this will boot the game).
2. Click "start".
3. Read the on-screen prompts and left-click (or space bar) to continue.
4. Select an option when it appears on screen (by left-clicking).
5. You can save at any point and return by using the "load" option from the menu.

Note: Select "help" from the menu for more assistance.
